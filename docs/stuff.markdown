# omor stuff: some internal short-hand codes in omorfi databases

_This is an automatically generated documentation based on omorfilexical database._

Stuff are internal things, but they appear in database a lot, so you will want to know what they are if you are gonna modify database of affixes.

The stuff is typically used by the file format and/or analysis generators to either define analysis tags or decide whether or not to include the affected string into language model. The default renditions for a handful of omorfi tag formats are provided (only ones that have trivially mapped formatting are included.


## Stuffs in tabular format

The symbols are default output variants without context-sensitive filtering.
This means that some symbols may be further modified in python code of the
outpyt formatter.
