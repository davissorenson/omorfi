# Omorfiâ€“Open morphology of Finnish

![open morphology of finnish](https://flammie.github.io/omorfi/omorfi.png)

Omorfi is a free and open source project containing various tools and data for
natural language processing of Finnish based on a knowledge driven paradigm.
Some of the potential use cases it may be suitable for are:

* morphosyntactic analysis, e.g. generate [unimorph](//unimorph.github.io) or
  [universal dependencies](//universaldependencies.org) analyses from word-forms
  or text
* building named entity recognisers, sentiment analysis or other high level
  apps
* building rule-based machine translation, e.g.
  [apertium-fin](//github.com/apertium/apertium-fin)

The main components of this repository are:

1. _a lexical database_ containing hundreds of thousands of words (c.f.
   [lexical statistics](statistics.html))
1. a collection of _utility scripts_ to process Finnish texts on command-line
   (c.f. [usage examples](usage.html))
1. a collection of _conversion scripts_ to convert lexical database into formats
   upstream NLP tools (c.f. [lexical processing](database-processing))
1. an _autotools setup_ to build and install (or package, or deploy): the
   scripts, the database, and simple APIs / convenience processing tools
1. a collection of relatively [simple APIs](apis/html/) with bindings for a
   selection of programming languages and scripts to apply the NLP tools and
   access the database

The fileformats we produce are (links to free open source implementations
included):

1. lexc, as processed by [HFST](//hfst.sf.net) and
   [foma](//code.google.com/p/foma), to be used for *morphological analysis*,
   *stemming*, *segmentation*, *natural language generation*, *hyphenation* and
   as a basis for *language models*,
   1. we provide [pre-built automata binaries for each release as a convenient
   download](https://github.com/flammie/omorfi/releases)
2. [apertium](//sf.net/p/apertium), to be used for *machine translation*
    * See [apertium-fin](//github.com/apertium/apertium-fin)
3. [voikko](//voikko.puimula.org), to be used for *spell-checking* and
   *correction* (also experimental _hunspell_ for legacy spell-checking)
4. _kotus-sanalista_, _lexical markup framework_, _tab-separated values_, etc.
   for long and short term storage, intermediate formats.

## Documentation

The most recent version of this documentation is online on [github pages at
https://flammie.github.io/omorfi/](https://flammie.github.io/omorfi/) (should be
this page).

### Basics

Read this first:

1. [README](README.html)
1. [Installation](install.html)
1. [Usage examples](usage.html)

### Bindings

Using omorfi language models from a programming language (python, C++ or java):

1. [API design](API-design.html)
1. [doxygen apidocs](apis/html/)

### Statistics and generated listings

There's some [semi-automatically generated statistics](statistics.html)
available.

We also have generated documentation for some aspects of database, such as
paradigms or noteworthy words:

1. [Words](lexemes.html), particularly those that are problematic (a FAQ for
   word entries, in a way)
1. [Paradigms](paradigms.html), i.e. inflection patterns
1. [Internal keys and codes](stuff.html)
1. [All forms of *kauppa*](genkau3.html), a retake on old experiment

### Design, historical notes, stuff

Some notes about design and development

1. [Design "principles" for tags](tagging-possibilities.html)
1. [Directory layout](directory-layout.html)
1. [Database structure](database-processing.html)
1. [Testing](regression-testing.html)

## Contact

If you want to discuss about omorfi in Finnish or English, there is a [matrix
chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#omorfi:matrix.org). The google group discussion
list omorfi-devel@groups.google.com ([Google groups web interface
here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/omorfi-devel)) can also be used,
it may require subscription but is very low volume. Suggestions, bug reports,
corrections and new lexical data can be sent using [github's omorfi issue
tracker](//github.com/flammie/omorfi/issues). Pull requests are accepted.

## Alternatives of omorfi

For many NLP tasks a neural language model may be more suitable and they are
relatively easy to use and customise these days. Check ðŸ¤—HuggingFace or
Turku-NLP for examples.

If omorfi doesnâ€™t suit your needs, you may want to try other similar products:
[suomi-malaga](http://voikko.puimula.org) of voikko fame is another
morphological analyser of Finnish. [Grammatical
Framework](http://www.grammaticalframework.org/) also has NLP components for
Finnish, and itâ€™s written in _haskell_.
For modern neural network approaches, see [TurkuNLP and their
parsers](https://turkunlp.org/finnish_nlp.html#parser)

If you want to use commercial products, there are surely some available
somewhere.
